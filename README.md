# k_means-CUCEI

made 4 "Mineria de datos" in CUCEI

Code made with K-MEANS Algorithm, using pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib, 
wrote in Spyder IDE. 

Spyder does not come with sklearn so needed to install it, using Anaconda, thus making it the default kernel
to also installing future Py modules in the future easier.

You got comments in every step of code, so u donÂ´t get lost.
